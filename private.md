Fundraising: One option for fundraising is to sell off a lot of the digital assets that I've collected from various blockchain based games, including Blockchain Cuties and Gods Unchained.

I can sell them in ARC which people can forge using WRLD. This system should fuel an initial price spike in ARC and WRLD, which hopefully I can use to get more things to sell for a while. One of the main challenges is that a lot of my stuff is on ETH. I'm not sure how I could sell my stuff and accept Tron payments.
