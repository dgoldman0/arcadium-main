# Summary

Titles are powerful NFTs in the Arcadium ecosystem and represent cross game operability. They are themselves going to be utilized in multiple games, and will act as the governance token for the ecosystem. Having both a governance role and a utility as a mult-game asset will allow titles to grow in value.

Each title has a rank. The highest ranked title is a god title, and is created through a special process. All other titles can be "minted" via higher rank titles.

## Raffles

One of the first ways titles will be used is through special raffle events. We'll create a standard for raffle tickets, and each provincial title may be used to redeem a raffle ticket for a given raffle event.

# Game Features

## Brawl

One of the first uses for titles will be in a brawl system. Titles will represent heroes who can be trained. The more they're trained, the more experience and abilities they'll get, allowing them to battle more powerful foes. Elements from Elementarius will be used as the basis for training. Time, and luck will also play major factors in successful training. Titles will need to be recharged over time or they won't be able to fight.

Players should be careful about picking their battles. Training can lead to increased positive stats. But there are also weaknesses and other flaws that will show up, as heroes lose in combat. Luckily, special objects will be available that can help train the hero, or alter their stats in interesting ways.

# Mutli-Game Governance

One of the main features of the titles is for leveraging voting rights in multiple games. The system will work through the creation of governance interfaces, which will store governance tokens of other projects, and interface with their governance systems. The amount of leverage available will depend on how much of a project's governance tokens the interface maintains.

Arcadium will create a standard for governance interfaces so that any project can integrate the Arcadium system into their own project. It will also launch a number of governance interfaces for select projects. However, it will be up to a project's own community to create the majority of interfaces. Various options are available to entice people to transfer some of their governance tokens to the project, including staking.
