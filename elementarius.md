# Elementarius - A Game of Creation

## The World

***The world of Elementarius is a primordial world, ruled by the gods and their angels.***

In the beginning there was only Light and Darkness, ruled by Avera and Khe. After spending an unknown amount of time with each other, they decided that their world needed something more. Together, they forged a new element, Spirit, and using this new element each gave birth to two more gods. Avera gave birth to Sia, the god of air and Yil, the god of fire, while Khe gave birth to FroÃ°, the god of water, and Hira, the god of Earth.

Over time, these four children of the Ur-beings started to became lonely and bored, with only the endless void to fill their eternal lives. They asked their parents to create a world for them. And so Avera and Khe, using both of elements of Light and Darkness created a number of angels for their children.

## The Elements

There are seven elements in the world of Elementarius, each controlled by its own god, with the exception of Spirit, which is the unified force of all the gods. These elements are used to craft items and even living beings within the world of Elementarius.

## Players

When joining the world of Elementarius, players take on the role of angels, forging new items, lands, and creatures for their patron gods.

## Puzzles

- Jigsaw puzzles give Earth
- Trivia questions give Water
- Memory games give Air
- Logic grid puzzles give Fire

## Element Creation

Only the four basic elements can be produced using the puzzle system. Light and Darkness are created from these four base elements, and Spirit is created from combining Light and Darkness. But only skilled users can combine these elements.

- Air + Fire -> Light
- Earth + Water -> Darkness
- Light + Darkness -> Spirit

## Using Elements

Elements can be used to create items and even living entities in this world. To create items, users will spend mana. Different mana combinations will create different items. Producing creatures works similarly, but requires Spirit.

Elements will also be used to create land and grow the world of Elementarius. This feature will be added later, but lands will have a significant impact on the game.

## Items

Numerous items can be crafted from elements. Some of these items can be used as equipment. Others can be used to help to collect mana from the puzzles.

### Mana Stones

Mana stones are crystalized mana. Depending on how they form, these stones can help with puzzles or be used in the process of creation. There are a number of types of mana stones which serve different functions. For each type, there are Air, Fire, Earth, and Water stones. They come in various rarities: common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary. These items can be crafted from mana, purchased from the market, or obtained by opening mana packs. Lower quality stones can also be broken down for mana or combined together to create more powerful mana stones.

Stones of insight increase the mana generation for getting a puzzle correct. Stones of creation are used when creating items. Stones of life are needed when forming creatures. Whether solving puzzles of creating things in the world, players will need a common stone of the required type, at the very least. Using the stones can be tricky however, as there's always a chance that the stone will shatter.

## Creature Battles & Play to Earn

Like with many blockchain based games, creatures will be used to compete with other players. Creatures can simply be purchased from other players who create them, or they can be created from the elements themselves. Each creature has its own elemental attributes which can make it stronger or weaker against other opponents.

Battles will be randomized but stats will make a big difference in whether the creature wins or loses.

### Equipping

Creatures can be equipped with various items to make them stronger in battle. Equipment can be used to increase healing speed, total HP, resistance to various elements, and so on.

### Leagues

In order to prevent a player from crushing weaker opponents, players will rank up into higher leagues as they perform better. Creature abilities will be limited while playing in lower leagues.

### Earning

As players compete with one another, they'll earn ARC. How much a player wins will depend on the pool size, the league, and the difference in rank between each player.
