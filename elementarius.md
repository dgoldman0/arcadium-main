# Elementarius - A game of creation from fundamentals

## The World

## The Elements

## Puzzles

- Jigsaw puzzles give Earth
- Trivia questions give Water
- Memory games give Air
- Logic grid puzzles give Fire

## Element Creation

Only the four basic elements can be produced using the puzzle system. Light and Darkness are created from these four base elements, and Spirit is created from combining Light and Darkness. But only skilled users can combine these elements.

- Air + Fire -> Light
- Earth + Water -> Darkness
- Light + Darkness -> Spirit

## Using Elements

Elements can be used to create items and even living entities in this world. To create items, users will spend mana. Different mana combinations will create different items. Producing creatures works similarly, but requires Spirit.

## Creature Battles & Play to Earn

Like with many blockchain based games, creatures will be used to compete with other players. Creatures can simply be purchased from other players who create them, or they can be created from the elements themselves.

### Equipping

Creatures can be equipped with various items to make them stronger in battle.

### Leagues

In order to prevent a player from crushing weaker opponents, players will rank up into higher leagues as they perform better. Creature abilities will be limited while playing in lower leagues.

### Earning

As players compete with one another, they'll earn ARC. How much a player wins will depend on the pool size, the league, and the difference in rank between each player.
